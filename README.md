## Prerequisites

To use the Silly stories Word add-in sample, the following are required.

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) to serve up the docx files.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies.
* JQuery, for the Office UI Fabric [dropdown](dev.office.com/fabric/components/dropdown) component.
* Word 2016, or any client that supports the Word Javascript API. This sample does a requirement check to see if it is running in a supported host.

## Start the web application

1. Install project dependencies with Node's package manager (npm) by running ```npm install``` in the project's root directory on the command line.
2. Start the development server by running ```node server.js``` in the project's root directory. The add-in will be running at 127.0.0.1:8080.

### Configure and run on Word for Mac 2016

1. Create a folder called “wef” in Users/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.word/Data/Documents/
2. Put the manifest in the wef folder (Users/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.word/Data/Documents/wef)
3. Open Word 2016 on the Mac and click on the Insert tab > My Add-ins drop down. You should see the add-in listed in the drop down. Select it and it will load the add-in.

### Configure and run on Word for Windows 2016

1. Create a network share, or [share a folder to the network](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770880.aspx) and place the [word-add-in-sillystories.xml](word-add-in-sillystories.xml) manifest file in it. You've deployed your add-in at this point. Now you need to let Word know where to find the add-in.
2. Launch Word and open a document.
3. Choose the **File** tab, and then choose **Options**.
4. Choose **Trust Center**, and then choose the **Trust Center Settings** button.
5. Choose **Trusted Add-ins Catalogs**.
6. In the **Catalog Url** box, enter the network path to the folder share that contains word-add-in-sillystories.xml and then choose **Add Catalog**.
7. Select the **Show in Menu** check box, and then choose **OK**.
8. A message is displayed to inform you that your settings will be applied the next time you start Office. Close and restart Word. 

Now you are ready to run it in Word. 

1. Open a Word document. 
2. On the **Insert** tab in Word 2016, choose **My Add-ins**. 
3. Select the **Shared folder** tab.
4. Choose **Silly stories add-in**, and then select **Insert**.
5. The add-in will load in a task pane. See figure 1 to see how it will look when it gets loaded.
